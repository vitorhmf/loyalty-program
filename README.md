<img src="image/cover_loyalty_program.png" width="1000">

## 1. Abstract

This repository contains the solution of clustering valuable clients in order to launch a loyalty program called Insiders

**Keywords:** Python, Pandas

## 2. Methodology

The CRISP-DM methodology was the guide for this data science project development. 

CRISP-DM, which stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, is an industry-proven way to guide your data mining efforts and it includes descriptions of the typical phases of a project, the tasks involved with each phase, and an explanation of the relationships between these tasks.

## 3. Business Understanding

### 3.1. Context

The company All in One Place is a Multibrand Outlet that sells second-line products from various brands at a lower price, through an e-commerce.

In just over 1 years of operation, the business team realized that some customers from its base buy more expensive products, with high frequency and end up contributing a significant portion of the company's revenue. Based on this perception, the marketing team decided to launch a loyalty program for the best customers in the base, called Insiders.

This project aims to solve the demand to carry out a selection of customers eligible for the Insiders program, using advanced data manipulation techniques.

The clustering will be performed from a dataset with 541,909 purchase records, 4,373 customers and carried out between December 2010 and December 2011. The attributes are described below:


| Feature                | Definition                                                                                               |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Invoice Number         | Unique identifier for each transaction                                                                   |
| Stock Code Product     | Item code                                                                                                |
| Description Product    | Item name                                                                                                |
| Quantity               | The quantity of each item purchased per transaction                                                      |
| Invoice Date           | The day the transaction took place                                                                       |
| Unit Price             | Product price per unit                                                                                   |
| Customer ID            | Unique customer identifier                                                                               |
| Country                | The name of the country the customer resides in                                                          |

## 4. Data Understanding

### 4.1. Data Cleaning

To build an overview of the data, the following steps were performed:
* Change the columns name to sneak_case;
* Shows the data dimensions (rows and columns);
* Check and Fillout NA: The initial dataset contained 135,080 records without the customer id. As it represents about 25% of the dataset, this data could not be simply disregarded. To solve this problem, customers ids were created starting from the number 19000 for each record that did not contain this attribute.

### 4.2 Data Descriptive: 

A quick descriptive analysis of numerical and categorical variables was performed.
 
**Numerical Attributes:**

Negative quantity and unit price indicate returns. These cases will be dealt with later.

**Categorical Attributes:**

<img src="image/cat_attributes.png" width="700">

The fact that the invoice number and stock code features appear as categorical attributes indicates that we have some records that have letters in their compositions and not just numbers as would normally be expected.
 
### 4.3. Feature Engineering

In this step, the following features were created:
* Gross Revenue:
* Recency:
* Quantity of purchases:
* Quantity of diferent products purchased:
* Quantity of items:
* Frequency:
* Returns:
* Satisfaction Rate:

### 4.4. Data Filtering

* Bad Users:
* Categorical Attributes:
* Numerical Attributes:
